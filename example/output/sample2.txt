                     Clinical History
                     The patient, [redacted], was referred due to symptoms of persistent abdominal
                     discomfort, mild jaundice, and significant weight loss over three months. Imaging (MRI)
                     indicated a mass in the hepatic region. Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and marginally raised
                     AFP levels were noted. Family history of malignancy prompted this biopsy request. Previous
                     cases include benign adenomas from [redacted] (Ref: File No. [redacted]}.

                                                    Details
                       Feature
                       Dimensions                   2.5 cm (length) x 0.3 cm (diameter)
                       Appearance                   Firm, tan-brown tissue with slightly granular texture; no gross necrosis
                                                    or hemorrhage
                       Observations                 Nodular surface, tan color, and homogenous consistency
                       Special Notes                No encapsulation or defined margins, suggesting invasive nature
                     Microscopic Findings
                     Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was performed, and slides reveal the following features:
                                  Cellular Architecture: The tissue displays a nodular pattern with dense cellularity,
                                  suggestive of a potential neoplastic process. Cells are predominantly polygonal with
                                  abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.
                                  Nuclear Features: Nuclei appear pleomorphic, with occasional large nucleoli. Some
                                  cells display mitotic figures, although at a low rate.
                                  Fibrosis and Vascularity: A moderate degree of fibrosis is present, interspersed with
                                  small-caliber blood vessels. Areas with mild vascular proliferation and congestion are
                                  noted.
                                  Infiltrative Edges: The lesion shows poorly defined infiltrative margins, potentially
                                  extending beyond the biopsy core, indicative of invasive behavior.
                       Immunohistochemical Analysis
                       Immunohistochemistry was conducted using the following panel:
                                  HepPar-1: Positive, indicating hepatic origin.
                                  CK7/CK20: Negative, suggesting the lesion may be primary rather than metastatic from
                                  other adenocarcinomas.
                                  Glypican-3: Positive, which is often associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.
                                  Ki-67 Proliferation Index: Approximately 20%, indicating a moderately proliferative
                                  activity, consistent with a low-to-moderate grade malignancy.
                                  p53 Mutation Analysis: Mild aberrations were observed, but no definitive mutations
                                  indicating aggressive pathology were noted.
                       Additional Testing Recommendations
                                  Genomic Testing: Due to the family history of malignancy and presence of hepatic
                                  lesion, genomic sequencing could provide further insight into specific driver mutations.
                                  Repeat Imaging: Follow-up MRI with contrast enhancement in 4-6 weeks to assess
                                  growth rate and lesion progression.
                                  Clinical Consult: Immediate oncological referral for treatment options.
                      Summary Diagnosis
                       Primary Diagnosis                  Hepatocellular carcinoma ([redacted]), low-to-moderate grade with
                                                          moderate fibrosis and low mitotic index
                       Clinical Stage                     Likely early stage; infiltrative features suggest need for follow-up
                                                          staging via imaging
                                                          Favorable with early intervention; close monitoring advised for
                       Prognosis
                                                          potential invasive spread
                      Recommendations and Prognosis
                      Early intervention is suggested based on low-to-moderate grade findings. Options include
                      surgical resection, depending on the lesion’s proximity to vascular structures. Additional
                      therapies such as localized ablation may be discussed following final staging.
                      Follow-Up:
                                 Consultation with Oncologist: Discuss further intervention options based on lesion
                                 staging.
                                 Genetic Counseling: Due to family history and potential genetic predispositions.
